## Notice

- This script has not been tested for tweets that are liked by over 4000 people.
- The block operation ***CANNOT BE UNDONE***. **Think twice** before blocking and consider whether you really need to block that group of users.
- You can only block users shown in the likers' page. There will sometimes be users who like a tweet but cannot be shown in the list. This script cannot block them.
